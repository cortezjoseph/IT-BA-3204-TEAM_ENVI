# Introduction
# Problem Statement
  We are reaching a turning point in our understanding of the impact of climate change, which is the most important issue of our time. The effects of climate change are worldwide in scope and unparalleled in scale, ranging from changing weather patterns that threaten food production to increasing sea levels that raise the risk of catastrophic flooding. Without prompt attention right away subsequent responses to these effects will be more challenging and costly.
  
  As a result of industrialization, deforestation, and large-scale agriculture that has lasted for more than a century and a half, the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has reached record heights that haven't been seen in three million years. As populations, economies and standards of living grow, so does the cumulative level of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions. Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels – coal, oil, or gas – causes a large chunk of the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide that blanket the Earth and trap the sun’s heat. Cities are major contributors to climate change. According to UN Habitat, cities consume 78 per cent of the world’s energy and produce more than 60 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, they account for less than 2% of the Earth’s surface. The sheer density of people relying on fossil fuels makes urban populations highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Fewer green spaces exacerbate the problem. According to the IPCC report, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would “require rapid and far-reaching transitions in uses of energy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and buildings), and industrial systems.”
