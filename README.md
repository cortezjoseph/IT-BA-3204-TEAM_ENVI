### Introduction
-----
### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
-----
<p align = "center">Renewable energy solutions are becoming cheaper, more reliable and more efficient every day.Our current reliance on fossil fuels is unsustainable and harmful to the planet, which is why we have to change the way we produce and consume energy. Implementing these new energy solutions as fast as possible is essential to counter climate change, one of the biggest threats to our own survival.</p>

### Problem Statement
-----
We are reaching a turning point in our understanding of the impact of climate change, which is the most important issue of our time. The effects of climate change are worldwide in scope and unparalleled in scale, ranging from changing weather patterns that threaten food production to increasing sea levels that raise the risk of catastrophic flooding. Without prompt attention right away subsequent responses to these effects will be more challenging and costly.

As a result of industrialization, deforestation, and large-scale agriculture that has lasted for more than a century and a half, the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has reached record heights that haven't been seen in three million years. As populations, economies and standards of living grow, so does the cumulative level of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions. Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels – coal, oil, or gas – causes a large chunk of the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide that blanket the Earth and trap the sun’s heat. Cities are major contributors to climate change. According to UN Habitat, cities consume 78 per cent of the world’s energy and produce more than 60 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, they account for less than 2% of the Earth’s surface. The sheer density of people relying on fossil fuels makes urban populations highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Fewer green spaces exacerbate the problem. According to the IPCC report, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would “require rapid and far-reaching transitions in uses of energy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and buildings), and industrial systems.”

### Significance of the Proposed Project
-----
Ineffectiveness of energy sources and
The transition of systems is a barrier to economic and human progress. The environment offers a variety of renewable and non-renewable energy sources, including uranium, sun, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and biofuels. 

Global climate change consequences will result from increased fossil fuel use in the absence of mitigation measures for greenhouse gas emissions. Disaster risk reduction and climate change mitigation are both facilitated by the usage of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency.
