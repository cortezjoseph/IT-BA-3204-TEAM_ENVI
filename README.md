### Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to wake up each day without realizing how awesome it is to be alive and living on Earth. Of all the planets out there, we were lucky enough to be on this green and blue planet full of wonderful ecosystems that are unique, inspiring and life-giving. Our every breath, our food and water- our very existence comes from nature.  Our very survival depends on the laws of nature all working perfectly together and in harmony. We need healthy forests and oceans to regulate global temperatures from rising. We need a stable climate to propagate agriculture to feed the world. We need animals and plant species to thrive for ecosystems to fully function. For life on Earth to continue to exist, we need nature to do what it does best: sustaining life it gives homes to. With all the noise and distractions of modern-day life, we have failed to recognize this remarkable fact and take the environment for granted.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans are responsible for climate change largely due to our greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases trap heat from the sun as it passes through Earth’s atmosphere. There are some natural greenhouse gases, such as water vapor and carbon dioxide (CO2). But over time, humans have added more to the atmosphere, creating a massive heat trap.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists agree that human activity is the primary driver of what we’re seeing now worldwide. (This type of climate change is sometimes referred to as anthropogenic, which is just a way of saying “caused by human beings.”) The unchecked burning of fossil fuels over the past 150 years has drastically increased the presence of atmospheric greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide. At the same time, logging and development have led to the widespread destruction of forests, wetlands, and other carbon sinks—natural resources that store carbon dioxide and prevent it from being released into the atmosphere.
Right now, atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are the highest they’ve been in the last 800,000 years. Some greenhouse gases, like hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HFCs), do not even exist in nature. By continuously pumping these gases into the air, we helped raise the earth’s average temperature by about 1.9 degrees Fahrenheit during the 20th century—which has brought us to our current era of deadly, and increasingly routine, weather extremes. And it’s important to note that while climate change affects everyone in some way, it doesn’t do so equally: All over the world, people of color and those living in economically disadvantaged or politically marginalized communities bear a much larger burden, despite the fact that these communities play a much smaller role in warming the planet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ways of generating power for electricity, heat, and transportation, our built environment and industries, our ways of interacting with the land, and our consumption habits together serve as the primary drivers of climate change. While the percentages of greenhouse gases stemming from each source may fluctuate, the sources themselves remain relatively consistent.
Renewable energy is one of the most effective tools we have in the fight against climate change, and there is every reason to believe it will succeed. A recent New York Times column seems to imply that renewable energy investments set back efforts to address climate change—nothing could be further from the truth. What’s more, renewable technologies can increasingly save customers money as they displace emissions from fossil fuels.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind and solar energy have experienced remarkable growth and huge cost improvements over the past decade with no signs of slowing down. Prices are declining rapidly, and renewable energy is becoming increasingly competitive with fossil fuels all around the country. In some places, new renewable energy is already cheaper than continuing to operate old, inefficient and dirty fossil fuel-fired or nuclear power plants.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move forward, there are a number of grid planning practices and technologies that will help facilitate America’s transition to higher and higher amounts of renewable energy. Demand response and time of use electricity pricing can provide similar support. Leading states are currently contemplating how to design policies and market structures that support a modernized, low-carbon grid. Planning for the future can and must be done in parallel with promoting strong renewables growth in the present. Renewable energy is already helping address climate change. It’s time to put our feet on the accelerator.

### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

<p align = "center">Renewable energy solutions are becoming cheaper, more reliable and more efficient every day. Our current reliance on fossil fuels is unsustainable and harmful to the planet, which is why we have to change the way we produce and consume energy. Implementing these new energy solutions as fast as possible is essential to counter climate change, one of the biggest threats to our own survival.</p>

**<p align="center">Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy </p>**

**<p align="center">Goal 13: Climate Action </p>**

<p align = "center">Climate change is a real and undeniable threat to our entire civilization.The effects are already visible and will be catastrophic unless we act now. Through education, innovation and adherence to our climate commitments, we can make the necessary changes to protect the planet. These changes also provide huge opportunities to modernize our infrastructure which will create new jobs and promote greater prosperity across the globe.</p>

### Problem Statement
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are reaching a turning point in our understanding of the impact of climate change, which is the most important issue of our time. The effects of climate change are worldwide in scope and unparalleled in scale, ranging from changing weather patterns that threaten food production to increasing sea levels that raise the risk of catastrophic flooding. Without prompt attention right away subsequent responses to these effects will be more challenging and costly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of industrialization, deforestation, and large-scale agriculture that has lasted for more than a century and a half, the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has reached record heights that haven't been seen in three million years. As populations, economies and standards of living grow, so does the cumulative level of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions. Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels – coal, oil, or gas – causes a large chunk of the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide that blanket the Earth and trap the sun’s heat. Cities are major contributors to climate change. According to UN Habitat, cities consume 78 per cent of the world’s energy and produce more than 60 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, they account for less than 2% of the Earth’s surface. The sheer density of people relying on fossil fuels makes urban populations highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Fewer green spaces exacerbate the problem. According to the IPCC report, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would “require rapid and far-reaching transitions in uses of energy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and buildings), and industrial systems.”

### Significance of the Proposed Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ineffectiveness of energy sources and the transition of systems is a barrier to economic and human progress. The environment offers a variety of renewable and non-renewable energy sources, including uranium, sun, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and biofuels. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global climate change consequences will result from increased fossil fuel use in the absence of mitigation measures for greenhouse gas emissions. Disaster risk reduction and climate change mitigation are both facilitated by the usage of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency.

### Methods

The researchers will use the datasets provided by Our World in Data to identify areas where renewable energy system efficiency can be improved and to forecast renewable energy demand and supply. The datasets to be used include Statista's global climate change data for observing and monitoring changes on a worldwide scale, as well as understanding and mitigating the effects of renewable energy on climate change. 

Data analysis tools are critical for comprehending the consequences of renewable energy and climate change, recognizing trends and patterns in data, and establishing effective climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.

The following are the data analysis methodologies used in renewable energy and climate change research:

Time-series analysis is used to examine data that has been collected over time. This technique can be used to analyze trends and patterns in renewable energy generation and consumption, as well as the long-term effects of climate change.

Geographic information systems (GIS) will be utilized to analyze spatial data. It is used to map and study renewable energy resources such as solar wind potential, as well as to estimate the effects of climate change on ecosystems and vulnerable populations.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a strategy for assessing the environmental implications of items or processes over their full life cycle. This technique can assist in identifying the environmental implications of renewable energy sources and comparing them to those of non-renewable energy sources.
