### Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forests cover about 30% of the Earth’s land surface. As forests grow, their trees take in carbon from the air and store it in wood, plant matter, and under the soil. If not for forests, much of this carbon would remain in the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), the most important greenhouse gas driving climate change.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forests are a crucial natural resource that might possibly be harvested and maintained responsibly to produce a variety of commodities with significant economic value. The most significant product taken from woods is by far wood. Paper, timber, plywood, and other goods are frequently made from the wood. Additionally, firewood is the most significant source of energy used for cooking and other purposes in the majority of the forested areas of the less developed world. All of these forest products may be harvested sustainably. Unfortunately, most of the time, forests have been unnecessarily overharvested, which has led to widespread ecological degradation and the "mining" of the forest resource. In the future, it is crucial that all forest harvesting be done in a way that is more considerate of maintaining the resource.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant contributor to the global climate change is deforestation. It is commonly recognized that deforestation is a major issue in the modern world, with hundreds, if not thousands, of acres of fragile forest being cleared for fuel and fertile farmland for cows and other livestock. This could have a severe impact on the climate in addition to increasing the rate of deforestation and resulting in the extinction of numerous species of plants, trees, and animals, many of which have yet to be found.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, we are unintentionally altering the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which could have a significant impact on the rest of the globe, by clearing vast tracts of forest without replacing the trees that are lost.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the analysis of this study focuses on its goals to create an environmental policy and make recommendations for an alternative, eco-friendly solution. These goals will not only aid in slowing down climate change but will also encourage the integration of climate change measures into national strategies, plans, and policies. Boost human and institutional capacity for mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning of climate change. Additionally, encourage appropriate access to these resources in accordance with international agreements, as well as fair and equitable sharing of the benefits resulting from the use of genetic resources.

### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

<p align = "center">Climate change is a real and undeniable threat to our entire civilization.The effects are already visible and will be catastrophic unless we act now. Through education, innovation and adherence to our climate commitments, we can make the necessary changes to protect the planet. These changes also provide huge opportunities to modernize our infrastructure which will create new jobs and promote greater prosperity across the globe.</p>

**<p align="center">Goal 13: Climate Action</p>**

**<p align="center">Goal 15: Life on Land</p>**

<p align = "center">Goal 15 is about conserving life on land. It is to protect and restore terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and stop biodiversity loss. Healthy ecosystems and the biological diversity they support are a source of food, water, medicine, shelter and other material goods. They also provide ecosystem services – the cleaning of air and water – which sustain life and increase resiliency in the face of mounting pressures.
</br>
Nevertheless, human activities have profoundly altered most terrestrial ecosystems: around 40,000 species are documented to be at risk of extinction over the coming decades, 10 million hectares of forest (an area the size of Iceland) are being destroyed each year, and more than half of key biodiversity areas remain unprotected.</p>

### Problem Statement
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Urbanization.** The rapid urbanization of the lands are caused by many problems, some inevitable consequences of growth and others avoidable mistakes that have been built up. The problems of urbanization are numerous, one being the deforestation of the woods and the increased need for resources. This rapid urbanization is caused by various problems from numerous sources. One of the causes would be the rapid increase of population and poor city planning. A second would be the need to change the areas, to transform rural areas into modern ones. Another cause would be the modernization and industrialization of cities that would need and consume copious amounts of a variety of resources. These issues bring forth more needs for land, resources, and producing more waste.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Global Warming.** By most accounts, deforestation in tropical rainforests adds more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than the sum total of cars and trucks on the world’s roads. According to the World Carfree Network (WCN), cars and trucks account for about 14 percent of global carbon emissions, while most analysts attribute upwards of 15 percent to deforestation.The reason that logging is so bad for the climate is that when trees are felled they release the carbon they are storing into the atmosphere, where it mingles with greenhouse gases from other sources and contributes to global warming accordingly. The upshot is that we should be doing as much to prevent deforestation as we are to increase fuel efficiency and reduce automobile usage.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Globalization: Economic Specialization.** One oft-overlooked side effect of globalization is that it allows nations and geographical regions to focus on their economic strengths, content in knowing they can turn to trading partners for goods they don’t produce themselves. This economic specialization often boosts productivity and efficiency.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, overspecialization can threaten forest health and lead to serious environmental issues, often in the form of habitat loss, deforestation, or natural resource overuse. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s worth considering that globalization has allowed some nations to specialize in producing various energy commodities, such as oil, natural gas, and timber. Nations that depend on energy sales to fund a large portion of their national budgets, along with those that note “energy security” as a priority, are more likely to take intervening actions in the market in the form of subsidies or laws that make transitioning to renewable energy more difficult.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main byproduct of these energy sources comes in the form of greenhouse gas emissions, which significantly contribute to global warming and climate change.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Globalization: Decreased Biodiversity.** Increased greenhouse gas emissions, ocean acidification, deforestation (and other forms of habitat loss or destruction), climate change, and the introduction of invasive species all work to reduce biodiversity around the globe.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the World Wildlife Fund’s recent Living Planet Report, the population sizes of all organisms—including mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and reptiles—have decreased 68 percent since 1970. Latin America and Africa—two rapidly developing regions important to global trade—have seen disproportionate levels of biodiversity loss, especially among environmentally sensitive fish, reptiles, and amphibians.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this decrease in biodiversity has many causes, it’s widely believed that the issues listed above have contributed in part.

### Significance of the Proposed Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planned initiative aims to solve this issue, and assisting in facing country's environmental issues. This study is extremely important to the following people:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**To the Community and its people.** Through this project, they can gain understanding of the issues' trends. They needed to be able to understand the main advantages they will experience after the problems are solved. In terms of environmental issues, it would enable the community and its residents to get education and exercise their fundamental liberties.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**To the Government and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).** They may utilize the knowledge from this effort to better their policies and align them. They can improve the implementation of their projects as well as their laws and regulations. Given their crucial role in the battle against climate change, the government may function as an anchor to connect residents with opportunities. They will profit from the initiative since it will enable them to serve the public more effectively while also increasing awareness. By doing this, they will learn more about this subject and be better able to pick and determine what is most valuable to everyone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**To the Future Researchers.** The results of this study will aid future academics in understanding how deforestation contributes to climate change. They may use it as a future reference for more research and it would help them become better analysts.

### Methods

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To evaluate and forecast the various potential consequences of deforestation on climate change, whether they are successful, practicable, or not, the researchers will use the datasets given by Mongabay: Deforestation Statistics Philippines and Climate Knowledge Portal. The datasets to be used include the Tropical Primary Forest Loss as well as the datasets of Tree Cover Loss data here in the Philippines, which can also be used to compare and assess the deforestation and forest loss in other countries in order to analyze whether a large-scale destruction tree can influence the change in global or regional climate patterns.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The methods used to analyze the aforementioned datasets and the connections between them are as follows:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers will use statistical analysis, which entails data gathering of all pertinent information required to examine and analyze the elements that lead to deforestation. This method will also be used to quantify all of the collected data and conduct other statistical analyses to see whether deforestation affects weather patterns, global warming, and other consequences as well.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the researchers will use Python as their main programming language because it is flexible and can handle the challenging datasets available for analysis, enabling them to perform better classification and statistical analysis.

### Expected Output


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of this research is to produce factual data that will be utilized to better understand the relationship between deforestation and its causes and shifting climatic trends. By examining the major influence of the widespread deforestation on climate change, this research seeks to enhance the analysis and comprehension of the data gathered through a better representation of principles and concepts that are simpler to comprehend and understand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criterion used to determine whether or not to modify and bring into effect the rules and regulation regarding deforestation will be based on the data that will be gathered and tested. Whatever the outcome of the analysis of the provided datasets, awareness of policies, guidelines, and recommendations will still be distributed and conveyed to the entire country in order to analyze and evaluate what course of action must be implemented next.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outcomes of the initiative would potentially analyze the caused by global tree loss, as well as its effects on the state of the weather and other natural resources. This assists the team in coming up with just and inclusive strategies for the development of the country and to contribute to the achievement of SDG 13 and SDG 15.
