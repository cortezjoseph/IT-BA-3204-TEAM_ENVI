### Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to wake up each day without realizing how awesome it is to be alive and living on Earth. Of all the planets out there, we were lucky enough to be on this green and blue planet full of wonderful ecosystems that are unique, inspiring and life-giving. Our every breath, our food and water- our very existence comes from nature.  Our very survival depends on the laws of nature all working perfectly together and in harmony. We need healthy forests and oceans to regulate global temperatures from rising. We need a stable climate to propagate agriculture to feed the world. We need animals and plant species to thrive for ecosystems to fully function. For life on Earth to continue to exist, we need nature to do what it does best: sustaining life it gives homes to. With all the noise and distractions of modern-day life, we have failed to recognize this remarkable fact and take the environment for granted.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans are responsible for climate change largely due to our greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases trap heat from the sun as it passes through Earth’s atmosphere. There are some natural greenhouse gases, such as water vapor and carbon dioxide (CO2). But over time, humans have added more to the atmosphere, creating a massive heat trap.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists agree that human activity is the primary driver of what we’re seeing now worldwide. (This type of climate change is sometimes referred to as anthropogenic, which is just a way of saying “caused by human beings.”) The unchecked burning of fossil fuels over the past 150 years has drastically increased the presence of atmospheric greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide. At the same time, logging and development have led to the widespread destruction of forests, wetlands, and other carbon sinks—natural resources that store carbon dioxide and prevent it from being released into the atmosphere.
Right now, atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are the highest they’ve been in the last 800,000 years. Some greenhouse gases, like hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HFCs), do not even exist in nature. By continuously pumping these gases into the air, we helped raise the earth’s average temperature by about 1.9 degrees Fahrenheit during the 20th century—which has brought us to our current era of deadly, and increasingly routine, weather extremes. And it’s important to note that while climate change affects everyone in some way, it doesn’t do so equally: All over the world, people of color and those living in economically disadvantaged or politically marginalized communities bear a much larger burden, despite the fact that these communities play a much smaller role in warming the planet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ways of generating power for electricity, heat, and transportation, our built environment and industries, our ways of interacting with the land, and our consumption habits together serve as the primary drivers of climate change. While the percentages of greenhouse gases stemming from each source may fluctuate, the sources themselves remain relatively consistent.
Renewable energy is one of the most effective tools we have in the fight against climate change, and there is every reason to believe it will succeed. A recent New York Times column seems to imply that renewable energy investments set back efforts to address climate change—nothing could be further from the truth. What’s more, renewable technologies can increasingly save customers money as they displace emissions from fossil fuels.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind and solar energy have experienced remarkable growth and huge cost improvements over the past decade with no signs of slowing down. Prices are declining rapidly, and renewable energy is becoming increasingly competitive with fossil fuels all around the country. In some places, new renewable energy is already cheaper than continuing to operate old, inefficient and dirty fossil fuel-fired or nuclear power plants.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move forward, there are a number of grid planning practices and technologies that will help facilitate America’s transition to higher and higher amounts of renewable energy. Demand response and time of use electricity pricing can provide similar support. Leading states are currently contemplating how to design policies and market structures that support a modernized, low-carbon grid. Planning for the future can and must be done in parallel with promoting strong renewables growth in the present. Renewable energy is already helping address climate change. It’s time to put our feet on the accelerator.

### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

<p align = "center">Climate change is a real and undeniable threat to our entire civilization.The effects are already visible and will be catastrophic unless we act now. Through education, innovation and adherence to our climate commitments, we can make the necessary changes to protect the planet. These changes also provide huge opportunities to modernize our infrastructure which will create new jobs and promote greater prosperity across the globe.</p>

**<p align="center">Goal 13: Climate Action</p>**

![22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114766731/235455772-43011b18-a7c4-4baf-ac0e-c9f0a4cf8d49.png)


**<p align="center">Goal 15: Life on Land</p>**

<p align = "center">Goal 15 is about conserving life on land. It is to protect and restore terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and stop biodiversity loss. Healthy ecosystems and the biological diversity they support are a source of food, water, medicine, shelter and other material goods. They also provide ecosystem services – the cleaning of air and water – which sustain life and increase resiliency in the face of mounting pressures.
</br>
Nevertheless, human activities have profoundly altered most terrestrial ecosystems: around 40,000 species are documented to be at risk of extinction over the coming decades, 10 million hectares of forest (an area the size of Iceland) are being destroyed each year, and more than half of key biodiversity areas remain unprotected.</p>

### Problem Statement
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Urbanization.** The rapid urbanization of the lands are caused by many problems, some inevitable consequences of growth and others avoidable mistakes that have been built up. The problems of urbanization are numerous, one being the deforestation of the woods and the increased need for resources. This rapid urbanization is caused by various problems from numerous sources. One of the causes would be the rapid increase of population and poor city planning. A second would be the need to change the areas, to transform rural areas into modern ones. Another cause would be the modernization and industrialization of cities that would need and consume copious amounts of a variety of resources. These issues bring forth more needs for land, resources, and producing more waste.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Global Warming.** By most accounts, deforestation in tropical rainforests adds more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than the sum total of cars and trucks on the world’s roads. According to the World Carfree Network (WCN), cars and trucks account for about 14 percent of global carbon emissions, while most analysts attribute upwards of 15 percent to deforestation.The reason that logging is so bad for the climate is that when trees are felled they release the carbon they are storing into the atmosphere, where it mingles with greenhouse gases from other sources and contributes to global warming accordingly. The upshot is that we should be doing as much to prevent deforestation as we are to increase fuel efficiency and reduce automobile usage.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Globalization: Economic Specialization.** One oft-overlooked side effect of globalization is that it allows nations and geographical regions to focus on their economic strengths, content in knowing they can turn to trading partners for goods they don’t produce themselves. This economic specialization often boosts productivity and efficiency.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, overspecialization can threaten forest health and lead to serious environmental issues, often in the form of habitat loss, deforestation, or natural resource overuse. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s worth considering that globalization has allowed some nations to specialize in producing various energy commodities, such as oil, natural gas, and timber. Nations that depend on energy sales to fund a large portion of their national budgets, along with those that note “energy security” as a priority, are more likely to take intervening actions in the market in the form of subsidies or laws that make transitioning to renewable energy more difficult.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main byproduct of these energy sources comes in the form of greenhouse gas emissions, which significantly contribute to global warming and climate change.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Globalization: Decreased Biodiversity.** Increased greenhouse gas emissions, ocean acidification, deforestation (and other forms of habitat loss or destruction), climate change, and the introduction of invasive species all work to reduce biodiversity around the globe.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the World Wildlife Fund’s recent Living Planet Report, the population sizes of all organisms—including mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and reptiles—have decreased 68 percent since 1970. Latin America and Africa—two rapidly developing regions important to global trade—have seen disproportionate levels of biodiversity loss, especially among environmentally sensitive fish, reptiles, and amphibians.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this decrease in biodiversity has many causes, it’s widely believed that the issues listed above have contributed in part.

### Significance of the Proposed Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ineffectiveness of energy sources and the transition of systems is a barrier to economic and human progress. The environment offers a variety of renewable and non-renewable energy sources, including uranium, sun, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and biofuels. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global climate change consequences will result from increased fossil fuel use in the absence of mitigation measures for greenhouse gas emissions. Disaster risk reduction and climate change mitigation are both facilitated by the usage of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency. Ecosystem preservation and protection enable for the continued use and advancement of hydropower and bioenergy sourcesof renewable energy sources and energy efficiency.

### Methods

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To evaluate and forecast the various potential consequences of deforestation on climate change, whether they are successful, practicable, or not, the researchers will use the datasets given by Mongabay: Deforestation Statistics Philippines and Climate Knowledge Portal. The datasets to be used include the Tropical Primary Forest Loss as well as the datasets of Tree Cover Loss data here in the Philippines, which can also be used to compare and assess the deforestation and forest loss in other countries in order to analyze whether a large-scale destruction tree can influence the change in global or regional climate patterns.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The methods used to analyze the aforementioned datasets and the connections between them are as follows:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers will use statistical analysis, which entails data gathering of all pertinent information required to examine and analyze the elements that lead to deforestation. This method will also be used to quantify all of the collected data and conduct other statistical analyses to see whether deforestation affects weather patterns, global warming, and other consequences as well. In particular, the researchers would also use Linear Regression Analysis, since analyzing the relationship between deforestation and climate change will be our main focus. In order to predict possible results and recommend different routes of action and options for all, this technique will help us to fully comprehend how a single factor is affected by another, whether it will remain constant or change.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the researchers will use Python as their main programming language because it is flexible and can handle the challenging datasets available for analysis, enabling them to perform better classification and statistical analysis.
