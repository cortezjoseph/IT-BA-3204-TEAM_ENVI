### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

<p align = "center">Renewable energy solutions are becoming cheaper, more reliable and more efficient every day.Our current reliance on fossil fuels is unsustainable and harmful to the planet, which is why we have to change the way we produce and consume energy. Implementing these new energy solutions as fast as possible is essential to counter climate change, one of the biggest threats to our own survival.</p>

**<p align="center">Goal 13: Climate Action </p>**

<p align = "center">Climate change is a real and undeniable threat to our entire civilization.The effects are already visible and will be catastrophic unless we act now. Through education, innovation and adherence to our climate commitments, we can make the necessary changes to protect the planet. These changes also provide huge opportunities to modernize our infrastructure which will create new jobs and promote greater prosperity across the globe.</p>

### Problem Statement
We are reaching a turning point in our understanding of the impact of climate change, which is the most important issue of our time. The effects of climate change are worldwide in scope and unparalleled in scale, ranging from changing weather patterns that threaten food production to increasing sea levels that raise the risk of catastrophic flooding. Without prompt attention right away subsequent responses to these effects will be more challenging and costly.

As a result of industrialization, deforestation, and large-scale agriculture that has lasted for more than a century and a half, the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has reached record heights that haven't been seen in three million years. As populations, economies and standards of living grow, so does the cumulative level of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions. Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels – coal, oil, or gas – causes a large chunk of the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide that blanket the Earth and trap the sun’s heat. Cities are major contributors to climate change. According to UN Habitat, cities consume 78 per cent of the world’s energy and produce more than 60 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, they account for less than 2% of the Earth’s surface. The sheer density of people relying on fossil fuels makes urban populations highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Fewer green spaces exacerbate the problem. According to the IPCC report, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would “require rapid and far-reaching transitions in uses of energy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and buildings), and industrial systems.”

### Significance of the Proposed Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ineffectiveness of energy sources and the transition of systems is a barrier to economic and human progress. The environment offers a variety of renewable and non-renewable energy sources, including uranium, sun, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and biofuels. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global climate change consequences will result from increased fossil fuel use in the absence of mitigation measures for greenhouse gas emissions. Disaster risk reduction and climate change mitigation are both facilitated by the usage of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency.

### Methods
-----
The researchers will use the datasets provided by Our World in Data to identify areas where renewable energy system efficiency can be improved and to forecast renewable energy demand and supply. The datasets to be used include Statista's global climate change data for observing and monitoring changes on a worldwide scale, as well as understanding and mitigating the effects of renewable energy on climate change. 

   Data analysis tools are critical for comprehending the consequences of renewable energy and climate change, recognizing trends and patterns in data, and establishing effective climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.

The following are the data analysis methodologies used in renewable energy and climate change research:

Time-series analysis is used to examine data that has been collected over time. This technique can be used to analyze trends and patterns in renewable energy generation and consumption, as well as the long-term effects of climate change.

Geographic information systems (GIS) will be utilized to analyze spatial data. It is used to map and study renewable energy resources such as solar wind potential, as well as to estimate the effects of climate change on ecosystems and vulnerable populations.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a strategy for assessing the environmental implications of items or processes over their full life cycle. This technique can assist in identifying the environmental implications of renewable energy sources and comparing them to those of non-renewable energy sources.
